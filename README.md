# Eeeehi! :sunglasses:

I'm **Francesco Conforte**. 

I got a bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering at [Universit√† Politecnica Delle Marche](https://www.univpm.it/) and an M.Sc. in [ICT for Smart Societies](https://www.didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/ict_for_smart_societies/en/home) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/). 

I want to present to you here some of the works I made both alone and with some of my colleagues during my studies at Politecnico. 

Feel free to comment and ask me if you want more insights! I would appreciate any comments you can give me! 

Enjoy!!

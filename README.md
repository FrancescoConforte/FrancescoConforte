# Eeeehi! :sunglasses:

I'm **Francesco Conforte**. 

I graduated in Electronic Engineering at [Universit√† Politecnica Delle Marche](https://www.univpm.it/) and currently, I'm an M.Sc. student in [ICT for Smart Societies](https://www.didattica.polito.it/laurea_magistrale/ict_for_smart_societies/en/home) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/). 

I would like to present you here some of my works I made both alone and with some of my collegues during my studies at Politecnico. 

Feel free to comment them and ask me if you want to know more insights! Any comment will be appreciated! 

Enjoy!!
